# cliPomodoro
## About
- cliPomodoro is an easy to use, minimal setup, pomodoro timer.
- This timer was created to help with eye strain, and follows the 20-20-20 rule. I.e. if you spend 20 minutes looking at a screen, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
- Other pomodoro applications force you to pay money to customize the timer, but this allows you to customize your timer, and works seamlessly on your work, school, or home computer (as long as you have python installed).

## How to use
### Requirements
- Have git installed
- Have python and a package manager of your choice installed (pip works fine)
